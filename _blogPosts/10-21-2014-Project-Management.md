<p>Often times projects don't get completed on time or under budget. Learn how project management software can keep your team in the loop and your project on track.</p>

<p>Anyone who has been given the responsibility of managing a project knows the obstacles that come with keeping on schedule, staying under budget, and facilitating teams of people. Being no stranger to that ourselves, we have created tools for other companies as well as for our own internal use, that make the task of effectively managing a project realistic.</p>

<p>On any project there are a lot of moving pieces whether you're building a deck or managing an expansion to a new facility. Often times dates get moved around, material prices change, sub-contractors don't show, and before you know it the schedule and budget are as good as gone.</p>

<p>Let's take the example of a construction company. A project manager has a variety of responsibilities, including, but not limited to: managing employees day to day tasks, coordinating sub-contractors' visits to the site for evaluation and implementation, managing customer relationships, checking email and messages to stay up to date with the main office. This amount of information can be overwhelming for one person to keep track of and often gets lost in translation.</p>

<p>When the scope of work or the hour of a meeting changes, material delivery is late, or the customer updates a request, not everyone on the team will be automatically updated, if at all. This makes it difficult to track what's getting done. That leads to the main office getting bits and pieces of information and a team in the field trying to finish a project on a faulty foundation.</p>

<p>Through our experience working with projects of various size we've seen anything and everything that can go wrong with a project. That's what led us to working on project management software that solves the headaches of staying on schedule, under budget, and in communication with your team. Project Management software is a framework for your every day processes that can be used as frequently or as little as necessary. Depending on how much communication you want, every major or minor change that happens can be pushed to anyone who needs to know automatically. </p>

<p>We have seen countless situations where teams work better and communicate more efficiently by letting software do the heavy lifting for them. Take the construction company as an example. With a project management system in place, the foreman can handle changes in the field and update everyone on the project as things occur. The system can alert people in the way that best suits them, whether it be text message, email, or otherwise.</p>

<p>Project management software is found in every industry and can be applied to any project. Each industry uses these systems in their own unique way because of how flexible software can be. A good way to implement a project management system at your company is to use it on a small project to get your feet wet. Chances are you and your team will find things you love and other things that need to be tailored to your specific needs. If you decide these systems are beneficial to your team and process, it's important to find a tool that can grow with your company.</p>

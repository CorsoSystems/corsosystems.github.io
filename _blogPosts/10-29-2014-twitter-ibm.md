<p>Twitter and IBM partner up to give businesses a better understanding of how their customers feel.</p>

<br>Just when you thought big data couldn't get any bigger, Twitter and IBM recently announced a new partnership. Here's the breakdown of the deal and what it means for consumers, developers, and big corperations.</p>

<p>IBM's super computers like WATSON (which has been known to beat most humans in chess and jeprody) will gain acess to all twitter data. On the surface you might wonder what exactly IBM is looking to do with all of that arbitrary data, but Chris Moody, Twitters VP of Data Strategy, breaks it down for us.</p>

<p>Starting small with a pilot test of performance monitoring at your company has some distinct advantages:</p>
<br/>
<h5><b>1. Wax on, Wax off</b></h5>
<p>Just like most other things you have learned in life reading about it doesn't alone make you a master. Instead you learn more by starting with a small goal, figuring out how to achieve it and growing from there.</p>

<h5><b>2. ...And that's the bottom line</b></h5>
<p>By starting small you can prove the capability of performance monitor to provide an ROI. You can also learn how to build the tools into the culture and avoid wasting valuable resources by over-developing your tools up-front.</p>

<h5><b>3. Engagement should come naturally</b></h5>
<p>With a comprehensive approach to performance monitoring you will inevitably get pushback from some people who feel like they are being forced into a new paradigm. By starting small you can work with the people most likely to embrace the change and allow them to become your internal champions. Getting buy-in prior to rolling out performance monitoring is a much better way to ensure its success.</p>

<br/>
<h5><b>Looking Ahead</b></h5>
<p>The next question you might have is where you should look to start with your performance monitoring efforts. Depending on your company you may have a lot of options, we will look at some common ones and some case studies in future posts.</p>

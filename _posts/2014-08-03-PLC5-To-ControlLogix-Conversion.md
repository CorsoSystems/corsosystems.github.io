<h3>Summary</h3>
A large potato processing facility in central Idaho replaced Allen Bradley PLC5 processors with ControlLogix and CompactLogix processors and wanted to ensure the new logic conformed to corporate programming standards.

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Facility upgraded to modern hardware</li>
	<li>Logic was updated to current corporate programming standards</li>
	<li>Updating logic to new standards required no unplanned downtime</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Allen Bradley PLC5</li>
	<li>Allen Bradley ControlLogix PLCs</li>
	<li>Allen Bradley CompactLogix PLCs</li>
	<li>Rockwell Automation RSLogix5</li>
	<li>Rockwell Automation RSLogix5000</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
The facility's maintenance staff performed the PLC5 to ControlLogix/CompactLogix conversion and did not have the time to update the logic, addressing, etc. to current corporate programming standards.

Our staff reviewed all of the affected logic and created new tags to match current naming conventions. From there we did a line-by-line upgrade of the logic (off-site) to match current standards.

During a scheduled downtime for cleaning and other upgrades, we downloaded the new code into the PLCs and spent time on-site verifying the new logic adjacent to the old logic. As the various routines were verfied we updated the I/O mapping to use the new tags and deleted the old tags and logic from the PLC. 

When we had completed verifying all of the logic the PLC was upgraded to current standards and required no unplanned downtime as part of the process.

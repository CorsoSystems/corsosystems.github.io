	<li>Power meter, inverter and string box information</li>
	<li>Weather station information monitoring</li>
	<li>Three levels of access, Public, Customer and Maintenance</li>
	<li>Automated billing documentation generation and dissemination</li>
	<li>Alarm notifications via email and text message</li>
	<li>Automated updates of on-site signage indicating power produced and emissions saved</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ASP.NET</li>
	<li>Red Lion Data Station Plus</li>
	<li>SQL Server</li>
	<li>B&B Electronic Modbus Converters</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
Our staff met with the operations team for a start-up solar power provider to discuss a developing a web-based monitoring system. The goal was to provide a low-cost, high functionality monitoring system for 3 facilities between 1 and 3 MW each.

We utilized Red Lion Data Station Plus units at each facility to collect data from field equipment and send it via cellular modem to a centralized database. This data was then displayed using trend controls on the site which allowed users to select date ranges, filter on equipment types and specific pieces of equipment.

If someone accessed the site without login credentials they were presented with a graph of power production limited to 30 days prior and older. If they accessed the site and were one of the customers or the owners of the facility where the plant was located they could see current overall production data and weather station information.

If the user was part of the solar company or their maintenance team they had access to all current production data for all equipment and weather station information. They could also manage what alarms sent notifications, who received billing information and administer users of the system. They also had access to a trend allowing them to add any datapoints from the site for completely customized data analysis.

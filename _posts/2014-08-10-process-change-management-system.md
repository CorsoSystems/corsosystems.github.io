<h3>Summary</h3>
Our staff worked with a leading diatomaceous earth processing facility to implement a centralized, web-based Process Change Management System. 

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Process change requests are now stored in a central database</li>
	<li>Process changes can be tracked throughout their lifecycle in one location accessible at anytime</li>
	<li>Changes are searchable, sortable and are no longer stored in files on a server reducing the amount of time required to find an old process change request</li>
	<li>Information about who created the change request is stored automatically</li>
	<li>Affected personnel are automatically notified when a process change request is submitted and/or approved</li>
	<li>Process change approvals are now requested automatically by the system reducing the amount of time spent managing the approval workflow</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ASP.NET MVC</li>
	<li>SQL Server</li>
	<li>jQuery</li>
	<li>Javascript</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
Our client is very aware of new technology and is always looking for ways to both optimize their process and find new materials capable of withstanding the harsh environment their product creates while it is being processed. As a result they frequently upgrade portions of their process and keep excellent documentation on these changes.

Prior to this project process changes were requested by filling out an Excel document, saving it on the corporate server and printing out multiple copies for people to review and approve the change. Managing this process required a significant amount of time relaying information and collecting approvals or modifications to the request before it could be approved.

Our system replaces this Excel document with a web-based interface. When creating a new change request the creator can select different people or titles required to approve the change as well as different individuals or departments required to be notified of the change. This process now happens automatically as soon as the change request is generated. 

In addition to the initial notifications an approvals engine is used to manage the process of completing a change. Once the change has been implemented the change requestor marks it as complete in the system. The Safety Coordinator is the notified and requested to mark it complete. It goes through as many rounds of this as needed based on the change's impact until the Plant Manager is notified and the change is marked as complete in the system. This process reduces the amount of time the change requestor spends tracking people down and getting their approvals. It also makes it easier for people to communicate their concerns about a change by being made aware of the change earlier in the process.

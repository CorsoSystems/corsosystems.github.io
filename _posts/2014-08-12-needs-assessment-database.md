<h3>Summary</h3>
An engineering firm required a system to manage needs assessment data for small rural water treatment facilities.

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All needs assessment data was stored in a centralized database</li>
	<li>Reports on all assessment data can be generated on-demand</li>
	<li>Assessments can be searched based on a variety of fields including tags assigned to each record</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ASP.NET MVC</li>
	<li>SQL Server</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
An engineering firm had a contract with the State Department of Environmental Protection to perform a needs assessment for all small rural water treatment systems. The assessment was used to determine the allocation of funds from the State to be used for various engineering tasks required to maintain the water systems or bring them up to current standards.

The firm required a centralized database accessible my their own staff as well as State staff who needed to access the reports once the assessments were complete.

Our staff developed and implemented the database and a web-based interface to handle customer relationship management (CRM) functionality for contacting the water systems, manage the questionnaires and to handle data entry and reporting after completing each assessment. Additional functionality alowing users to tag assessments with common issues was later implemented to allow for easy search and tracking various analytics about all of the assessed water systems.

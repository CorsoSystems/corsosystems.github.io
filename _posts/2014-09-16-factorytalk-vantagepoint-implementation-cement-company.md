<h3>Summary</h3>
<p class="left-align">A large cement manufacturing company wanted to historize process data from one of its facilities and view the data using modern trending and reporting tools.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul class="left-align">
	<li>Process data stored in a centralized database</li>
	<li>Data accessible from outside of the HMI application, including access to corporate staff</li>
	<li>Automated reporting capability reduced amount of time collecting data required for periodic reporting on various process conditions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul class="left-align">
	<li>FactoryTalk Historian</li>
	<li>FactoryTalk VantagePoint</li>
	<li>Allen Bradley ControlLogix PLCs</li>
	<li>SQL Server</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p class="left-align">We worked with the client's process engineer to identify which datapoints they wanted to store as well as to develop the VantagePoint model for making the data easily accessible to operators and maintenance staff.</p>

<p class="left-align">Once we had determined the relevant data we implemented the system and provided training for the facility's staffon using FactoryTalk Historian and VantagePoint.</p>

<p class="left-align">The 500 tag licensed system took less than one day to commission after showing up on-site with only the software installed on the server.</p>

case_study_title: "Energy Bar Packaging Facility Conveyor Speed Sync"
summary: "An energy bar packaging facility worked with us to replace a faulty mixer control system and upgrade it to modern standards."
image: "/img/conveyor.png"
detail_summary: "<p>An energy bar manufacturing facility's raw ingredient mixer had a faulty Cutler Hammer PLC and operator interface.</p>
		<p>We reverse-engineered the control logic and upgraded the Cutler Hammer equipment with an Allen Bradley Micrologix PLC and Panelview Plus operator interface.</p>
		<p>The new system included recipe management functionality configurable by the operators during their shift.</p>"

results_table: "Results"
focus: "<li>Decrease production fluctuations</li><li>Update equipment to modern standards</li><li>Incorporate recipe management</li>"
drive: "<li>Implement control logic</li><li>Develop operator interface based on existing standards</li><li>Implement system and train personnel on its operation</li>"
results: "<li>Increased productivity</li><li>Decreased productions fluctuations</li><li>Decreased maintenance overhead</li>"
solution: "<p>The client's existing process line consisted of 8 stand-alone machines taking raw ingredients, forming them into bars, enrobing in chocolate and drying them prior to entering the packaging line.</p><p>Each of these machines has a conveyor with a locally configurable speed for each piece of equipment. Operators were spending a signficant amount of time adjusting the speeds for each piece of equipment when changing products, resulting in issues when the speeds were not exactly the same.</p><p>We implemented a system using Allen Bradley CompactLogix PLC and Panelview Plus to communicate with Powerflex 4 and 5 VFDs installed on each piece of equipment.</p><p>The local control capability for each machine was replaced by a screen on the Panelview Plus allowing the operators to set a desired speed and the PLC calculating the required values for each drive based on its conveyor properties and gear ratios. The operators were also given the capability to configure speeds for various products giving them a drop-down menu to cut changeover times essentially to zero with respect to adjusting the speed of the line.</p>"

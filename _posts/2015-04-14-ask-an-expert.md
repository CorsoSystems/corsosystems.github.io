<p>We get asked a lot of questions. Mostly about what in the world we actually do for a living. Thankfully most people have seen "How It's Made" or are aware of the fact Disney theme parks do not in fact run on magic making these two easily relatable examples of what we are capable of doing.</p>
<br/>
<p>Sometimes the questions are more difficult:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How do I interface a certain PLC with a certain piece of software?</li>
	<li>Is the price I am being charged for this work fair?</li>
	<li>Can you find an easy way to tell when my bottles are full? Everything we have tried hasn't worked.</li>
	<li>My business has nothing to do with manufacturing, what can I do to improve my operation?</li>
	<li>What is MES, PLM, SCADA, PMP, PE, ERP, and SIL, and why should I care?</li>
	<li>How do I find the right people for my team?</li>
	<li>Can this super complicated work flow be simplified so I don't have to spend 90% of my day troubleshooting confusion?</li>
</ul>
 <br/>
<p>We enjoy answering questions. The more difficult the better. Why?</p>

<br/>
<h4></b>The more information you have, the better decisions you can make.</b></h4>

<p>Simple, right?</p>
<br/>
<p>When you have <b>more information</b> the number of options available <b>increases</b>. You can see <b>new possibilities</b> and find new ways to get where <b>you want to be</b>.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just need some moral support. We have been there. Knowing someone else has been down the same road is sometimes all you need to push through into new territory.</p>
<br/>
<h3>What are we offering?</h3>

<h4>We are giving you an open invitation to ask us questions.</h4>
<br/>
<p>Sure, there are some limits, obviously we can't do an entire project for you out of the goodness of our hearts. What we can offer is some of our time to help you. Think of it as our version of office hours.</p>

<p>You are welcome to any of the information we are allowed to share, any of our ideas, and our opinions and advice about any issues you may be facing.</p>

<p>Anything from our unbiased take on any software you may be considering, a second opinion on an estimate, help with a design, pretty much anything you can throw at us.*</p>

<p>*Don't worry, if you cross a line, we'll let you know.</p>
<br/>
<p>It doesn't even have to be manufacturing related. Want some help navigating social media? What podcasts we listen to when we are driving to a job-site? What beer we had in some far-away land and are craving to this day? What about the best places to eat wherever we have done a project?</p>
<br/>
<p>You name it, you got it, just ask us. We'll keep any and all information completely confidential. If you ask a question we think would be valuable to the rest of the world, we will ask if we can share it with the world and leave out any info you ask us to.</p>
<br/>
<p>Let's start a conversation.</p>

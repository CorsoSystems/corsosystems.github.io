<p>How do you prioritize your workload?</p>

<p>You probably have some hot-button items always at the top of the list, usually of great importance to someone else, some things in the middle important to you, and some things at the bottom that would be nice but not critical to complete.</p>

<p>How <b><i>should</i></b> you prioritize your workload?</p>

<p>One way is using Pareto Analysis. Here is an example of why a processing plant shutdown over a certain period of time:</p>

<p>The data behind this is pretty simple. Track the number of occurrences of each downtime reason, sort them in descending order, and put them on a bar chart, with the count on the left y-axis. Next, plot a line of each the percentage each bar contributes to the total downtime count with the value on the right y-axis. This shows you the most common causes of downtime from left to right, and the percentage they are contributing to the whole.</p>

<p>How is this useful?</p>

<p>By sorting information in this way, you can quickly see that if you were to eliminate the 2 most common causes of downtime, you would reduce downtime occurrences over this period nearly 50%. To demonstrate this, draw a vertical line to the right of a bar to the percentage line. Where this line crosses the percentage line, draw a horizontal line to the right y-axis to get the total percent for the downtime reasons up to that point.</p>

<p>You can apply this method to just about any situation in your plant:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Quality issues</li>
	<li>Safety incidents</li>
	<li>Maintenance issues</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are already tracking things like OEE, you can leverage Pareto Analysis tools as a drill-down report in your OEE reports to show the underlying root causes of quality, throughput, or cycle time issues.</p>

<p>Another powerful way to use Pareto Analysis is to go beyond simply ordering by number of occurrences, and instead by duration. What if you have 100 instances of downtime due to mechanical issues, averaging one minute per instance, but you have 4 instances of downtime due to power failures, averaging 2 hours per instance? Going by number of occurrences fixing the mechanical issues would be a huge win, but would have little impact on overall downtime compared to reducing power failures.</p>

                <title>Introduction to Process Data Systems</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how process data systems can enable you to track your brewing operation more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/bottlingline.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letâ€™s say you run a small brewery. You take your raw ingredients, run them through the mashing and boiling processes, let the liquid ferment and finally put it into bottles or cans to be shipped to your customers. Odds are your goal is to product a consistent product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with your recipe you likely have a clipboard to track data for each batch. The amount of raw ingredients, what variety of hops, how long you boiled everything, fermentation duration, alcohol content, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have run a complete batch through quality control you might generate some more data on color, taste, clarity, and so on. The recipe and all of the data you collect during the brewing process can easily be entered into a system making this data more valuable than a sheet of paper in a filing cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a drawer as the final home for your data, imagine you open a web-browser, log in to a site and input the data into a database. For each step of the brewing process you can pull up a report comparing this batch to any or all of your previous batches and get a detailed view of how it compares. You can even have a good idea of what your final product will look like based on all of your experience with the data to back up your gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/datasystemscreen.png&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real value of the system comes when you make subsequent batches and generate more data. If you make a particularly great tasting batch, can you easily identify what was different about the process compared to a normal batch? Were there any differences in your ingredients? Would you like to be able to repeat your results and have the ability to spot trends in your final products? When a major distributor picks up your product and you need to increase production how easily can you ramp up production to meet demand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions are all things a large brewer like Anheuser-Busch has answered. They track a lot of data for every batch. If something ends up tasting off in the end product they can compare the batch to every other batch in their database and diagnose likely causes. They track the effect of various ingredients on the final product, finding ways to brew consistent tasting products at any of their facilities. Granted their brewing process is heavily automated which simplifies data collection, the concepts of using a centralized data collection system to brew smarter can be implemented in any size brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have have had the opportunity to implement similar systems that make the lives of operators and artisans easier. Once people get their hands on this type of technology they get excited about what they can do next. Turning data into information makes it easy to increase productivity, consistency, and customer satisfaction. Intelligent information about a process truly expands the horizon of what is possible and gives people the tools to operate at their highest potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

                <title>Project Management Basics</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Often times projects don&#39;t get completed on time or under budget. Learn how project management software can keep your team in the loop and your project on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/flowchart.jpg&quot; width=&quot;430px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been given the responsibility of managing a project knows the obstacles that come with keeping on schedule, staying under budget, and facilitating teams of people. Being no stranger to that ourselves, we have created tools for other companies as well as for our own internal use, that make the task of effectively managing a project realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On any project there are a lot of moving pieces whether you&#39;re building a deck or managing an expansion to a new facility. Often times dates get moved around, material prices change, sub-contractors don&#39;t show, and before you know it the schedule and budget are as good as gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s take the example of a construction company. A project manager has a variety of responsibilities, including, but not limited to: managing employees day to day tasks, coordinating sub-contractors&#39; visits to the site for evaluation and implementation, managing customer relationships, checking email and messages to stay up to date with the main office. This amount of information can be overwhelming for one person to keep track of and often gets lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the scope of work or the hour of a meeting changes, material delivery is late, or the customer updates a request, not everyone on the team will be automatically updated, if at all. This makes it difficult to track what&#39;s getting done. That leads to the main office getting bits and pieces of information and a team in the field trying to finish a project on a faulty foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/lightbulb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our experience working with projects of various size we&#39;ve seen anything and everything that can go wrong with a project. That&#39;s what led us to working on project management software that solves the headaches of staying on schedule, under budget, and in communication with your team. Project Management software is a framework for your every day processes that can be used as frequently or as little as necessary. Depending on how much communication you want, every major or minor change that happens can be pushed to anyone who needs to know automatically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen countless situations where teams work better and communicate more efficiently by letting software do the heavy lifting for them. Take the construction company as an example. With a project management system in place, the foreman can handle changes in the field and update everyone on the project as things occur. The system can alert people in the way that best suits them, whether it be text message, email, or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project management software is found in every industry and can be applied to any project. Each industry uses these systems in their own unique way because of how flexible software can be. A good way to implement a project management system at your company is to use it on a small project to get your feet wet. Chances are you and your team will find things you love and other things that need to be tailored to your specific needs. If you decide these systems are beneficial to your team and process, it&#39;s important to find a tool that can grow with your company.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Bridging the Gap</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Many companies have a handful of systems they use to run their day-to-day operations. Production scheduling, process data from the plant floor, shipping and receiving management, staff scheduling, etc. Most of the time these systems are implemented at different points of a company&#39;s lifecycle and are not designed with the other systems in mind. With today&#39;s technology making it easy to integrate systems into a cohesive tool, see how you can get more value from your existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/digifactory.jpg&quot; width=&quot;430px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Mile in Your Shoes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we go to a facility for the first time we put ourselves in your shoes as we seek to understand your culture, people, and processes. We tend to find a few common, interesting things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Work orders are usually on a sheet of paper physically located at operator workstations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Inefficient communication throughout the entire process - from customer orders to the production floor all the way through order fulfillment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Machine maintenance being done too often or not often enough, causing too much planned or unplanned downtime&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Delays in the process not being communicated back to production scheduling causing an increase in lead times&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Quality control staff asking production staff for process data information costing time on both sides of the equation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these issues cause delays in order fulfillment and ultimately increase workload and stress on your staff. This not only can lead to mandatory overtime to meet production demand while still maintaining the delivery schedule, but also to not meeting customer expectations and possibly hurting relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the concept of the digital factory. By utilizing fully-integrated systems and mobile technology, production efficiency and employee effectiveness can operate at their highest potential. Let&#39;s take a look at a few ideas of how intelligent systems can streamline your operation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Communication Across the Organization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notification:&lt;/b&gt; Communication can happen automatically, alerting staff on a periodic or real-time basis about changes in production, maintenance issues, process metrics and KPIs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Documentation:&lt;/b&gt; Information on how to handle process upsets, workflow manuals or any other required documentation can be built directly into your systems no longer requiring operators to leave their station to ask a question&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Information:&lt;/b&gt; Process data can be made available from the shop to the top floor including QA/QC, shipping, sales, and management keeping everyone up-to-date at a level of granularity specific to their needs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organization:&lt;/b&gt; If you have more than one facility everyone in your entire company can keep up to date with all of your production facilities.&lt;br /&gt;You can also limit access to any portion of the system to specific employees, giving everyone access to the information they need to see, when they need to see it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Training and Best Practices&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tutorials:&lt;/b&gt; Training materials can be easily accessible when they are immediately useful making it easy for operators to accomplish periodic tasks in a timely manner and make it easy to cross train other employees on any job function&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internal Wiki:&lt;/b&gt; Best practices, detailed instructions and institutional knowledge can all be recorded making it easy to keep everyone up to speed on how things should be done at your company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Worker Productivity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maintenance:&lt;/b&gt; Your work order system can be directly integrated into plant floor data to automatically generate work orders as they are needed per manufacturer&#39;s specifications reducing under or over-maintaining equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance personnel can update and manage work orders with automatic notification to operators and other personnel as maintenance work is completed&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operations:&lt;/b&gt; Your operations staff can quickly see when process upsets will affect their workflow, as well as generate and monitor maintenance work-orders directly from their stations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metrics:&lt;/b&gt; In-app dashboards can show metrics for your facility keeping them front-of-mind for your staff. &lt;br /&gt;These metrics can include the KPIs you already use to track the health of your operation with the added benefit of brining up historical data to compare to previous production shifts at any time&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a handful of the potentially unlimited number of ideas on how you can utilize a fully integrated, intelligent system at your organization. When you empower your people to do their job more effectively you will see improvement in the KPIs and metrics you use to monitor the health of your operation. This can result in happier customers, employees and improve your bottom line by better utilizing the data you already have available.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Introduction to Process Data Systems</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how process data systems can enable you to track your brewing operation more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/bottlingline.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you run a small brewery. You take your raw ingredients, run them through the mashing and boiling processes, let the liquid ferment and finally put it into bottles or cans to be shipped to your customers. Odds are your goal is to product a consistent product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with your recipe you likely have a clipboard to track data for each batch. The amount of raw ingredients, what variety of hops, how long you boiled everything, fermentation duration, alcohol content, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have run a complete batch through quality control you might generate some more data on color, taste, clarity, and so on. The recipe and all of the data you collect during the brewing process can easily be entered into a system making this data more valuable than a sheet of paper in a filing cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a drawer as the final home for your data, imagine you open a web-browser, log in to a site and input the data into a database. For each step of the brewing process you can pull up a report comparing this batch to any or all of your previous batches and get a detailed view of how it compares. You can even have a good idea of what your final product will look like based on all of your experience with the data to back up your gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/datasystemscreen.png&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real value of the system comes when you make subsequent batches and generate more data. If you make a particularly great tasting batch, can you easily identify what was different about the process compared to a normal batch? Were there any differences in your ingredients? Would you like to be able to repeat your results and have the ability to spot trends in your final products? When a major distributor picks up your product and you need to increase production how easily can you ramp up production to meet demand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions are all things a large brewer like Anheuser-Busch has answered. They track a lot of data for every batch. If something ends up tasting off in the end product they can compare the batch to every other batch in their database and diagnose likely causes. They track the effect of various ingredients on the final product, finding ways to brew consistent tasting products at any of their facilities. Granted their brewing process is heavily automated which simplifies data collection, the concepts of using a centralized data collection system to brew smarter can be implemented in any size brewery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have have had the opportunity to implement similar systems that make the lives of operators and artisans easier. Once people get their hands on this type of technology they get excited about what they can do next. Turning data into information makes it easy to increase productivity, consistency, and customer satisfaction. Intelligent information about a process truly expands the horizon of what is possible and gives people the tools to operate at their highest potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

                <title>Project Management Basics</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Often times projects don&#39;t get completed on time or under budget. Learn how project management software can keep your team in the loop and your project on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/flowchart.jpg&quot; width=&quot;430px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been given the responsibility of managing a project knows the obstacles that come with keeping on schedule, staying under budget, and facilitating teams of people. Being no stranger to that ourselves, we have created tools for other companies as well as for our own internal use, that make the task of effectively managing a project realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On any project there are a lot of moving pieces whether you&#39;re building a deck or managing an expansion to a new facility. Often times dates get moved around, material prices change, sub-contractors don&#39;t show, and before you know it the schedule and budget are as good as gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s take the example of a construction company. A project manager has a variety of responsibilities, including, but not limited to: managing employees day to day tasks, coordinating sub-contractors&#39; visits to the site for evaluation and implementation, managing customer relationships, checking email and messages to stay up to date with the main office. This amount of information can be overwhelming for one person to keep track of and often gets lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the scope of work or the hour of a meeting changes, material delivery is late, or the customer updates a request, not everyone on the team will be automatically updated, if at all. This makes it difficult to track what&#39;s getting done. That leads to the main office getting bits and pieces of information and a team in the field trying to finish a project on a faulty foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/lightbulb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our experience working with projects of various size we&#39;ve seen anything and everything that can go wrong with a project. That&#39;s what led us to working on project management software that solves the headaches of staying on schedule, under budget, and in communication with your team. Project Management software is a framework for your every day processes that can be used as frequently or as little as necessary. Depending on how much communication you want, every major or minor change that happens can be pushed to anyone who needs to know automatically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen countless situations where teams work better and communicate more efficiently by letting software do the heavy lifting for them. Take the construction company as an example. With a project management system in place, the foreman can handle changes in the field and update everyone on the project as things occur. The system can alert people in the way that best suits them, whether it be text message, email, or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project management software is found in every industry and can be applied to any project. Each industry uses these systems in their own unique way because of how flexible software can be. A good way to implement a project management system at your company is to use it on a small project to get your feet wet. Chances are you and your team will find things you love and other things that need to be tailored to your specific needs. If you decide these systems are beneficial to your team and process, it&#39;s important to find a tool that can grow with your company.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Bridging the Gap</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Many companies have a handful of systems they use to run their day-to-day operations. Production scheduling, process data from the plant floor, shipping and receiving management, staff scheduling, etc. Most of the time these systems are implemented at different points of a company&#39;s lifecycle and are not designed with the other systems in mind. With today&#39;s technology making it easy to integrate systems into a cohesive tool, see how you can get more value from your existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/digifactory.jpg&quot; width=&quot;430px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Mile in Your Shoes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we go to a facility for the first time we put ourselves in your shoes as we seek to understand your culture, people, and processes. We tend to find a few common, interesting things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Work orders are usually on a sheet of paper physically located at operator workstations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Inefficient communication throughout the entire process - from customer orders to the production floor all the way through order fulfillment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Machine maintenance being done too often or not often enough, causing too much planned or unplanned downtime&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Delays in the process not being communicated back to production scheduling causing an increase in lead times&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Quality control staff asking production staff for process data information costing time on both sides of the equation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these issues cause delays in order fulfillment and ultimately increase workload and stress on your staff. This not only can lead to mandatory overtime to meet production demand while still maintaining the delivery schedule, but also to not meeting customer expectations and possibly hurting relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the concept of the digital factory. By utilizing fully-integrated systems and mobile technology, production efficiency and employee effectiveness can operate at their highest potential. Let&#39;s take a look at a few ideas of how intelligent systems can streamline your operation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Communication Across the Organization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notification:&lt;/b&gt; Communication can happen automatically, alerting staff on a periodic or real-time basis about changes in production, maintenance issues, process metrics and KPIs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Documentation:&lt;/b&gt; Information on how to handle process upsets, workflow manuals or any other required documentation can be built directly into your systems no longer requiring operators to leave their station to ask a question&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Information:&lt;/b&gt; Process data can be made available from the shop to the top floor including QA/QC, shipping, sales, and management keeping everyone up-to-date at a level of granularity specific to their needs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organization:&lt;/b&gt; If you have more than one facility everyone in your entire company can keep up to date with all of your production facilities.&lt;br /&gt;You can also limit access to any portion of the system to specific employees, giving everyone access to the information they need to see, when they need to see it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Training and Best Practices&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tutorials:&lt;/b&gt; Training materials can be easily accessible when they are immediately useful making it easy for operators to accomplish periodic tasks in a timely manner and make it easy to cross train other employees on any job function&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internal Wiki:&lt;/b&gt; Best practices, detailed instructions and institutional knowledge can all be recorded making it easy to keep everyone up to speed on how things should be done at your company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Worker Productivity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maintenance:&lt;/b&gt; Your work order system can be directly integrated into plant floor data to automatically generate work orders as they are needed per manufacturer&#39;s specifications reducing under or over-maintaining equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance personnel can update and manage work orders with automatic notification to operators and other personnel as maintenance work is completed&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operations:&lt;/b&gt; Your operations staff can quickly see when process upsets will affect their workflow, as well as generate and monitor maintenance work-orders directly from their stations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metrics:&lt;/b&gt; In-app dashboards can show metrics for your facility keeping them front-of-mind for your staff. &lt;br /&gt;These metrics can include the KPIs you already use to track the health of your operation with the added benefit of brining up historical data to compare to previous production shifts at any time&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a handful of the potentially unlimited number of ideas on how you can utilize a fully integrated, intelligent system at your organization. When you empower your people to do their job more effectively you will see improvement in the KPIs and metrics you use to monitor the health of your operation. This can result in happier customers, employees and improve your bottom line by better utilizing the data you already have available.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Eye On the KPI</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Most companies have complex processes. Keeping everyone up to date on every aspect of operations can take a lot of time and lead to lots of confusion. Find out what many companies have found to be a better way to track performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/kpiintro.jpg&quot; width=&quot;430px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keeping It Simple&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever procrastinate when you need to put together a report on how your company is doing on any given day? You may have to dig through a handful of reports, run some calculations in Excel and go interrupt some other people to get information on their department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if all of this work could be boiled down into an automatically generated report emailed out to everyone who needs the information? What if the report gave anyone who wanted to dig deeper the ability to get the information at the level of detail they want, on-demand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of system is one of the benefits of the idea of the digital factory. As each department completes its tasks relevant information is entered into the intelligence database. You and your staff determine the important metrics to measure and calculations you use to distill those metrics into a handful of numbers known as Key Performance Indicators or KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rubber Meets The Road&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a KPI? A KPI is a way to simply convey complex information. One example in the manufacturing world is known as Overall Equipment Effectiveness or OEE. This is a calculation involving the uptime of a process, the quality of produced goods, and how quickly those goods were produced. These values are compared to their ideal amounts giving you a percentage value of the health of your operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have this value you can determine if it meets your needs or if it needs to be improved. If it needs to be improved you drill down into the three component values and start asking questions. Is one of the metrics causing the number to drop quite a bit? Which one? If your line is accruing lots of unplanned downtime dig deeper and see how to fix it. If you are getting a larger than usual number of bad parts why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This functionality can be built directly into your system, automatically generating OEE per day, shift, etc. The values in the report can be directly linked to raw data allowing you to ask and answer any questions you may have about the data in the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will dig deeper into how you can implement KPIs at your company in the next few posts. For now here is a list of a few common KPIs we have helped out customers design systems around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;OEE - based on runtime, quality, process speed&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Average Production Per Shift - comparing shifts can lead to friendly competition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Downtime - reducing downtime increases productivity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Changeover Time - reducing changeover time increases process runtime&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Equipment/Process Alarms - tracking the number of alarms for various pieces of equipment can be an indicator of potential maintenance needs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reject Count - tracking reject counts per line or piece of equipment can give you indications of potential workflow or process changes you may want to implement&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>Piloting Your KPIs</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Implementing a KPI based performance monitoring program can be a complicated process. Learn how you can start small and avoid common pitfalls companies run into when rolling out a comprehensive system all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sugar.jpg&quot; width=&quot;430px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One mistake organizations make when rolling out performance monitoring is to try and capture all of the data at one time. Instead of building a cultural foundation it is taken on as a project with a lot riding on its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an easy approach to start out with based on the marketing material and training for performance monitoring methodologies. After consuming a handful of brochures, books and webinars it might seem that performance monitoring is a silver bullet to solve all of your companies needs. While it is a great tool, performance monitoring is just that and by not learning how to use it properly on the small scale it can fail to live up to its expectations at scale. If you were new to construction would you get more return in the long run by building a mansion as your first project or building up to that after starting with a playhouse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting small with a pilot test of performance monitoring at your company has some distinct advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Wax on, Wax off&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like most other things you have learned in life reading about it doesn&#39;t alone make you a master. Instead you learn more by starting with a small goal, figuring out how to achieve it and growing from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. ...And that&#39;s the bottom line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By starting small you can prove the capability of performance monitor to provide an ROI. You can also learn how to build the tools into the culture and avoid wasting valuable resources by over-developing your tools up-front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Engagement should come naturally&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a comprehensive approach to performance monitoring you will inevitably get pushback from some people who feel like they are being forced into a new paradigm. By starting small you can work with the people most likely to embrace the change and allow them to become your internal champions. Getting buy-in prior to rolling out performance monitoring is a much better way to ensure its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question you might have is where you should look to start with your performance monitoring efforts. Depending on your company you may have a lot of options, we will look at some common ones and some case studies in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Understand Your Processes</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The first step in measuring your performance is to understand what you are measuring. By learning and documenting your processes you can easily identify key results to use in your performance monitoring efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/flowchartmenu.jpg&quot; width=&quot;430px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is one of the first things Warren Buffett, one of the world&#39;s most successful investors, does when he buys a company? If most of his purchases are anything like some companies he recently purchased at which we know a lot of people, it is to understand and document their existing processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal behind this is two-fold. First it is to understand what the company has done to make it successful enough for him to want to purchase in the first place. The second is to see where the company&#39;s processes need to be streamlined or replaced with his own processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another benefit to this method as opposed to going into a company and revamping their entire workflow from the beginning. It makes it easier to get everyone&#39;s buy-in on the restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defense&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who are passionate about what they do, restructuring can be hard to swallow. They may have some personal investment in the processes themselves, having developed or influenced them along the way. Ripping out those processes and putting in new ones can immediately put someone in their position on the defensive. This isn&#39;t a bad thing or a character flaw, it is a normal reaction to hearing your way of doing things might not be the best way out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead if the processes are documented and understood they can be assessed on a level playing field with a different way of doing things. This can lead to fruitful discussions with the stakeholder in the original process feeling like they are being heard and can dramatically increase their level of buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;First and 10&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once discussions about the old and the new methodologies have taken place incremental changes can be made. This is not unlike American football in that the goal every play isn&#39;t to score a touchdown, it is to move the ball 10 yards down the field to maintain possession on the path to scoring a touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach breaks down the final result into small, easily digestible, and complete-able chunks. It also makes it easy to track progress and understand what is working and what needs to be adjusted along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two-Point Conversion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to obtaining buy-in, the other benefit to the incremental approach to change is the ability for there to be learning in both directions. Every so often there will be an idea Warren Buffett might adopt from one of his subsidiaries that can change how his other companies are run. To keep to the football analogy this is like the introduction of the two-point conversion to make the game a little more interesting to watch. This isn&#39;t necessarily going to be a complete overhaul of the system, just a subtle tweak to make it better overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post-Game Wrap-up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in implementing a performance monitoring strategy isn&#39;t to dive in and build a system with a dashboard and some metrics. The first step is to understand how your business operates and the processes used to run it day to day. Once you know those you can easily identify what you can and should measure to begin improving things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday you might make it to the Superbowl but first you need to be able to make it 10 yards down the field.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Twitter & IBM Team Up</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter and IBM partner up to give businesses a better understanding of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/twitter-ibm.jpg&quot; width=&quot;430px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Big Data At work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when you thought big data couldn’t get any bigger, Twitter and IBM recently announced a new partnership. Here’s the breakdown of the deal and what it means for consumers, developers, and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM&#39;s super computers like WATSON (which have been known to beat most humans in chess and Jeopardy) will gain access to all twitter data. On the surface you might wonder what exactly IBM is looking to do with all of that data, but Chris Moody, IBM&#39;s CEO breaks it down for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This partnership, drawing on IBM&#39;s leading cloud-based analytics platform, will help clients enrich business decisions with an entirely new class of data. This is the latest example of how IBM is re-imaging work&quot; -Ginni Rometty, Chairman, President and CEO, IBM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal on both ends of the deal. Twitter houses invaluable data such as how people feel about businesses and who they care about interacting with, while IBM holds the tools that can take that data and turn it into relevant information. Turning data into real world information is arguably more important than having the data itself, and this partnership is going to give businesses a better look at their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/twitterstats.png&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What It Means to Consumers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like it or not, everything you post on Twitter, or any form social media, is going to be used to better understand you. A common saying is &quot;if you are not paying for it, you are the product.&quot; This phrase is debatable on a case by case basis, but don&#39;t fret if you are worried about your personal information. IBM&#39;s tools are designed to gain a better understanding of trends in the market and are not focused on the specifics of individual user data. In a lot of cases, these technologies are responsible for giving you access to the best product or services. Ever wonder how a company like Amazon knew exactly what were you were looking for? Data analytics are there to thank when offering your the most relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What It Means to Developers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new partnership is great news for developers. Especially if you&#39;re one of ten thousand plus IBM Global business Services consultants developing business applications with twitter data. Twitter has been extremely transparent and supportive of developers by releasing tools such as Bootstrap, Fabric, and Digits. Twitter always has developers on their radar and does everything it can to help grow the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What It Means to Businesses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses should be jumping up and down with excitement about this partnership. Understanding your customers is invaluable and will enable you to give them what they want and need. Whether Twitter&#39;s data can help you understand how they feel about a product or service, or if you are looking for innovative ideas, IBM&#39;s amazing analytics tools have you covered and will help you understand your business on a deeper level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which category you fall in, everyone has some reason to be excited about two tech giants teaming up to better understand people as a whole. Twitter encapsulates far more than just individual opinions and ideas, hidden underneath the surface is a much clearer look at what everyone cares about and more importantly how they feel. With incredibly smart tools and more data than ever, I am excited to see what comes of this new partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

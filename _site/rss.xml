                <title>Multiple solar sites producing 109MW</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our staff worked with a leading solar power provider to develop and implement a standardized SCADA system for use at new solar power plants. We commissioned 16 plants producing 109MW of solar power using this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reduced development time for future plants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Standardized graphics, data structures and network topologies reduced maintenance and training requirements for future plants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Changes to the system at newer facilities could easily be pushed out to all existing facilities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Systems could be operated and maintained remotely&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Automated reporting for power production, billing and plant performance including alarms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wonderware System Platform
	&lt;li&gt;Wonderware InTouch&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wonderware Historian&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;OSI PI Historian&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;SQL Server&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;N-Tron networking equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Moxa Modbus communication equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cisco ASA Firewalls&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Juniper Firewalls&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
Our staff met with the SCADA operations team for a large solar power provider to discuss a standardized system built using Wonderware System Platform. The goal was to build objects for the various pieces of equipment at a solar plant, inverters, breakers, power meters, etc., to enable rapid deployment of SCADA systems for new facilities. 

As part of developing the system we developed a standardized naming convention for the facilities and all of the datapoints to allow a script to populate a centralized OSI PI Historian with data from each facility.

After completion of the initial development future systems took less time as the SCADA system was built using existing objects and commissioning was basically complete after I/O and communication verifications.

With remote access to each facility we also reduced support time and costs by allowing our staff to login to each system to make any neccessary modifications, including updating older facilities with any objects developed for newer facilities.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Energy Bar Conveyor Speed Sync</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An energy bar manufacturing facility had a number of standalone pieces of equipment on which they wanted the ability to set a global, synchronized speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stand alone equipment now integrated with a PLC to provide the capability for full-line automation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;8 pieces of equipment with local control can now be operated from one operator interface&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recipe management capabilities enable operators to configure speeds for various products and select them on the fly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Allen Bradley Powerflex VFDs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Allen Bradley CompactLogix PLC&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Allen Bradley Panelview Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client’s existing process line consisted of 8 stand-alone machines taking raw ingredients, forming them into bars, enrobing in chocolate and drying them prior to entering the packaging line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these machines has a conveyor with a locally configurable speed for each piece of equipment. Operators were spending a signficant amount of time adjusting the speeds for each piece of equipment when changing products, resulting in issues when the speeds were not exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We implemented a system using Allen Bradley CompactLogix PLC and Panelview Plus to communicate with Powerflex 4 and 5 VFDs installed on each piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local control capability for each machine was replaced by a screen on the Panelview Plus allowing the operators to set a desired speed and the PLC calculating the required values for each drive based on its conveyor properties and gear ratios. The operators were also given the capability to configure speeds for various products giving them a drop-down menu to cut changeover times essentially to zero with respect to adjusting the speed of the line.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Energy Bar Mixer Replacement</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An energy bar manufacturing facility’s raw ingredient mixer had a faulty Cutler Hammer PLC and operator interface. We reverse-engineered the control logic and upgraded the Cutler Hammer equipment with an Allen Bradley Micrologix PLC and Panelview Plus operator interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Controls brought up to modern standards&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Safety controls re-enabled as part of upgrade&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recipe management capabilities implemented as part of the upgrade&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stand-alone equipment now capable of being integrated into an overall process control system&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Customer has updated documentation and copies of all programs and logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Allen Bradley Micrologix 1100&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Allen Bradley Panelview Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met with the client to discuss their existing system and how both the PLC and operator interface were failing due to age and general wear and tear. The mixer had been installed when the plant was first opened in the early 90’s and no software was available for the Cutler Hammer PLC or operator interface 20 years after installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked with the plant operators to understand and develop a control philosophy for the mixer. One major issue with the existing hardware was that some of the inputs to the PLC from safety devices had failed. These issues were resolved with the upgraded PLC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operators also requested recipe management functionality, allowing them to easily configure various mixing steps depending on the product being produced. We implemented a screen in the HMI allowing them to configure a handful of steps with various mixing speeds and times which allowed them to reduce a large amount of over and under-mixing caused by manually timing steps using the old system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new system was commissioned, operators were trained and the process was back up and running by lunchtime. The client now has updated copies of all documentation putting them in a better position for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

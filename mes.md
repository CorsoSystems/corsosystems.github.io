		<p><b>Manufacturing Execution Systems</b> (<b>MES</b>) or <b>Manufacturing Operations Management</b> systems (<b>MOM)</b> encompass a wide array of intelligent tools enabling you to integrate process data with other business systems including <b>ERP</b> systems giving you a complete view of how all of the moving parts of your operation interact with one another.</p>

		<p>Typical MES systems include a handful of common tools including <b>Operational Equipment Effectiveness</b> <b>(OEE)</b> tracking, <b>quality monitoring</b>, <b>recipe management</b>, <b>energy management</b>, <b>statistical process control</b>, <b>scheduling integration</b>, and <b>work order management</b> to name a few. Each of these tools give you better information about your process and business, providing the insight you need to <b>cut costs</b>, <b>increase productivity</b>, and <b>increase revenue</b>.</p>

		<h4 style="text-align: left;">Corso Systems MES/MOM Development Philosophy</h4>
		<p>Our philosophy with MES and MOM systems is to develop easy-to-use systems to give you the information you need to run your company more efficiently. This starts with demonstrating how the system can <b>cut costs</b>, <b>increase productivity</b>, and <b>increase revenue</b>, while developing the <b>business case</b> for <b>capital justification</b>. We then help find the appropriate <b>technology</b> for your needs, based on existing infrastructure, number of facilities, support requirements, etc. We also spend time with corporate <b>stakeholders</b> and <b>IT</b> to find the best ways to integrate the systems with their workflows. After the system is designed and implemented, we provide <b>training</b>, <b>documentation</b>, and <b>support</b> for our customers to get the most value possible from their <b>investment</b>.</p>

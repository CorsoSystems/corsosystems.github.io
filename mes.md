No matter <b>how many facilities</b> you have, your MES/MOM system allows you to make <b>intelligent decisions</b> about all of them from <b>one interface</b>.</p>

		<p>MES/MOM systems <b>remove</b> the <b>limitations</b> and <b>hurdles</b> currently standing in the way of reaching your <b>maximum potential</b>.</p>

		<h4 style="text-align: left;">Corso Systems MES/MOM Development Philosophy</h4>
		<p>Our philosophy with MES and MOM systems is to develop easy-to-use systems to give you the information you need to run your company more efficiently. This starts with demonstrating how the system can <b>cut costs</b>, <b>increase productivity</b>, and <b>increase revenue</b>, while developing the <b>business case</b> for <b>capital justification</b>. We then help find the appropriate <b>technology</b> for your needs, based on existing infrastructure, number of facilities, support requirements, etc. We also spend time with corporate <b>stakeholders</b> and <b>IT</b> to find the best ways to integrate the systems with their workflows. After the system is designed and implemented, we provide <b>training</b>, <b>documentation</b>, and <b>support</b> for our customers to get the most value possible from their <b>investment</b>.</p>
